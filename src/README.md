# NHL-RINK-D3

This is a D3 package which generates an accurate scaled representation of a regulation NHL rink, as of 2018-19. Rulebook PDF included in repo.

Currently, system is completely vanilla JS, using D3.js and Underscore.js libraries.

Of note, the project includes a modular scaling solution, which converts from meters into pixels (relative to container's max height and width). This allows any dimension adjustments to be easily inputted into the dimension object model.
